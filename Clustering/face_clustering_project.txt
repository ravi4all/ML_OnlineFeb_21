K-Median Clustering
K-Medoids Clustering

Face Clustering
k = 5
1. Collect images of k different people (100-200 image per person)
2. Put all the images in a single folder
3. Read images one by one and detect face of each person
4. Store the face array in a list
5. Reshape the array of images into (eg : 1000 x 2500)
6. Now try Elbow method to check how many cluster it suggest
7. Now apply any one of clustering technique to classify images
8. Now create k folders using os package and name them 0,1,2,3,4
9. Now store the images of each person to there respective cluster folder.
10. Now test the algorithm be passing a new test image and check which cluster it predict and save it to that cluster folder.
